        /*Description

        Write a program that asks the user to enter information about a particular artistic work (it could be an album, movie, game, book, etc). Ask for at least five different attributes, like title, author, and genre. Save the information to a file as a JSON object. When the program runs again, it should read the file and print out the data, then give the user the option to update it.

        Requirements

        Prompt the user to answer at least five different questions about an artistic work.
        Save the information into a JSON object in a file.
        When the program first boots, read the file and display the contents.
        Give the user the ability to update the information and re-save it to the file.
        If the JSON parsing fails, give a friendly error rather than crashing the program.*/
